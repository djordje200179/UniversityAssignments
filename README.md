# University assignments

This is a repo with all university coding homeworks.

Most important of them are:
- Simple multithreaded RISC-V based kernel with efficient 
memory allocators for kernel types (OS1 projekat + OS2 projekat)
- E-commerce apps for posting and selling products
online (IS1 projekat + SAB projekat)
- Neural network for classification of dog breeds (NM projekat)
- Implementation of B* search tree (ASP2 DZ2)
- Design and verification of FPGA module for
interaction with PS2 keyboard (VLSI projekat)
- Comparison of multiple pathfinding algorithms (IS1 DZ1)
	- BFS
	- Djikstra
	- A*
- Comparison of multiple constraint satisfaction algorithms by 
filling the board with words (IS1 DZ2)
	- Backtracking
	- Forward checking
	- Arc consistency
