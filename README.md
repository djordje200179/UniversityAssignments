# University assignments

This is a repo with all university coding homeworks. 
The codes are quite patched to work due to the lack 
of time and too many projects during the university year.

If you want to see the code I'm actually writing, 
take a look at some of my other projects.

Most important of them are:
- Simple multithreaded RISC-V based kernel with efficient 
memory allocators for kernel types (OS1 projekat + OS2 projekat)
- E-commerce apps for posting and selling products
online (IS1 projekat + SAB projekat)
- Neural network for classification of dog breeds (NM projekat)
- Implementation of B* search tree (ASP2 DZ2)
- Design and verification of FPGA module for
interaction with PS2 keyboard (VLSI projekat)
- Comparison of multiple pathfinding algorithms (IS1 DZ1)
	- BFS
	- Djikstra
	- A*
- Comparison of multiple constraint satisfaction algorithms by 
filling the board with words (IS1 DZ2)
	- Backtracking
	- Forward checking
	- Arc consistency
- Custom aassembler, linker and emulator (SS)
- Dockerized e-commerce app for selling products with support 
for Ethereum blockchain payments and calculating statistics
with Apache Spark framework (IEP)
